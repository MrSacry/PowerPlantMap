# Interactive Power Plants Map

## Project Overview
The Interactive Power Plants Map is an innovative web application designed to visualize power plants across various regions. The map allows users to interactively explore different data points related to power generation, making it a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

## Interactive Features
1. **Legend**: Provides a clear understanding of the map symbols and colors used for different fuel types.
2. **Fuel Type Filters**: Users can filter power plants based on their fuel types (e.g., coal, gas, renewable, etc.), allowing for focused data analysis.
3. **Capacity Range Slider**: A slider that lets users set a range for the power generation capacity of the plants displayed on the map.
4. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific power plants by name or location, enhancing the ease of navigation.
5. **Summary Statistics**: Displays aggregated statistics about the power plants visible on the map, such as total capacity and the number of facilities.
6. **Enhanced Styling**: The map features enhanced visual styles, improving user experience and the aesthetic appeal of the application.
7. **Marker Clustering**: Grouping of markers that are close together to declutter the map and improve readability.
8. **Layer Controls**: Options to enable or disable different data layers on the map, providing users control over what information is shown.
